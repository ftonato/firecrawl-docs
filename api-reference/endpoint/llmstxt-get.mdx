---

Get the status and results of an LLMs.txt generation job. This endpoint allows you to check if the generation is complete and retrieve the generated content.

### Response Structure

The response includes:

- **success**: Boolean indicating if the request was successful
- **status**: Current status of the generation job:

  - `processing`: Job is still running
  - `completed`: Job finished successfully
  - `failed`: Job encountered an error

- **data**: Generated content (when status is `completed`):

  - `llmstxt`: The generated LLMs.txt content
  - `llmsfulltxt`: Full text content (if showFullText was true)

- **expiresAt**: ISO timestamp indicating when the results will expire

### Status Examples

1. **Processing Status**

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "status": "processing",
     "data": {
       "llmstxt": "# Firecrawl.dev llms.txt\n\n- [Web Data Extraction Tool](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)...",
       "llmsfulltxt": "# Firecrawl.dev llms-full.txt\n\n"
     },
     "expiresAt": "2025-03-03T23:19:18.000Z"
   }
   ```

2. **Completed Status**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "status": "completed",
     "data": {
       "llmstxt": "# http://firecrawl.dev llms.txt\n\n- [Web Data Extraction Tool](https://www.firecrawl.dev/): Transform websites into clean, LLM-ready data effortlessly.\n- [Flexible Web Scraping Pricing](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing): Flexible pricing plans for web scraping and data extraction.",
       "llmsfulltxt": "# http://firecrawl.dev llms-full.txt\n\n## Web Data Extraction Tool\nIntroducing /extract - Get web data with a prompt..."
     },
     "expiresAt": "2025-03-03T22:45:50.000Z"
   }
   ```

### Error Handling

If the generation job fails or cannot be found, you'll receive an appropriate error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "LLMs.txt generation job not found"
}
```

### Polling Recommendations

1. Poll every 2-3 seconds initially
2. Increase interval if still processing after 30 seconds
3. Stop polling if status is `completed` or `failed`
4. Implement exponential backoff to avoid rate limits
