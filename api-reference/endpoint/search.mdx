The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

## Supported query operators
