```python Python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape multiple websites:
batch_scrape_result = app.batch_scrape_urls(['firecrawl.dev', 'mendable.ai'], formats=['markdown', 'html'])
print(batch_scrape_result)

# Or, you can use the asynchronous method:
batch_scrape_job = app.async_batch_scrape_urls(['firecrawl.dev', 'mendable.ai'], formats=['markdown', 'html'])
print(batch_scrape_job)

# (async) You can then use the job ID to check the status of the batch scrape:
batch_scrape_status = app.check_batch_scrape_status(batch_scrape_job.id)
print(batch_scrape_status)
```
