Firecrawl V1 is here! With that we introduce a more reliable and developer friendly API.

Here is what's new:

- Output Formats for `/scrape`. Choose what formats you want your output in.
- New [`/map` endpoint](/features/map) for getting all of the URLs of a webpage.
- `/crawl` webhooks and websocket support.
- `onlyMainContent` is now default to `true`.
- Developer friendly API for `/crawl/{id}` status.
- 2x Rate Limits for Standard and Growth plans.
- Go SDK and Rust SDK
- Teams support
- API Key Management in the dashboard.

## Scrape Formats

You can now choose what formats you want your output in. You can specify multiple output formats. Supported formats are:

- Markdown (markdown)
- HTML (html)
- Raw HTML (rawHtml) (with no modifications)
- Screenshot (screenshot or screenshot@fullPage)
- Links (links)

Output keys will match the format you choose.
