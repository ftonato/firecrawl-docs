## /scrape endpoint

The updated `/scrape` endpoint has been redesigned for enhanced reliability and ease of use. The structure of the new `/scrape` request body is as follows:

```json
{
  "url": "<string>",
  "formats": ["markdown", "html", "rawHtml", "links", "screenshot", "json"],
  "includeTags": ["<string>"],
  "excludeTags": ["<string>"],
  "headers": { "<key>": "<value>" },
  "waitFor": 123,
  "timeout": 123
}
```

### Formats

You can now choose what formats you want your output in. You can specify multiple output formats. Supported formats are:

- Markdown (markdown)
- HTML (html)
- Raw HTML (rawHtml) (with no modifications)
- Screenshot (screenshot or screenshot@fullPage)
- Links (links)
- JSON (json)
By default, the output will be include only the markdown format.

### Details on the new request body

The table below outlines the changes to the request body parameters for the `/scrape` endpoint in V1.

| Parameter | Change | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `onlyIncludeTags` | Moved and Renamed | Moved to root level. And renamed to `includeTags`. |
