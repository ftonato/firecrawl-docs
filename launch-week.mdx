## Day 5 – Developer Day
![Dev Day](/images/launch-week/lw3-d5-1.webp)

### Overview
Today is all about developers. We’re rolling out upgrades that make building with Firecrawl smoother and more scalable — whether you’re working in Python, Rust, or your favorite editor.

We’ve introduced a fully async Python SDK with named params and return types, powerful new features in the Rust SDK, expanded team support on every plan, and a brand new Firecrawl Dark Theme for VSCode and compatible editors.

### Key Features
- **Major Python SDK Improvements**: Named params, return types, and Async added to our Python SDK
- **Rust SDK Upgrades**: Batch scraping, job cancellation, llms.txt generation, smarter search.
- **Firecrawl Dark Theme**: A sleek new theme for VSCode, Cursor, and Windsurf. Download it here.
- **QoL Improvements**: Plenty of small but meaningful changes to improve dev experience like no more team caps. All plans now include up to 20 seats.

## Day 4 – LLMstxt.new

### Overview  
Today we’re announcing [http://llmstxt.new](http://llmstxt.new) — the fastest way to turn any website into a clean, consolidated text file for LLMs.

Just add `llmstxt.new/` in front of any URL, and you’ll get back a plain `.txt` file, optimized for AI training and inference. No boilerplate, no noise — just useful content.

Built on top of Firecrawl, this tool makes it effortless to prepare real-world web content for use in LLM pipelines.

![LLMs.txt Generator Interface](/images/launch-week/lw3-d4-2.webp)

### Key Features  
- **Instant Usage**: Just add `llmstxt.new/` before any URL.  
- **Two Outputs**: `llms.txt` for concise summaries, `llms-full.txt` for full content.  
- **API Friendly**: Call via `http://llmstxt.new/{YOUR_URL}` or with a Firecrawl API key for full output.  
- **LLM-Ready Format**: Designed for both training and inference contexts.  

## Day 3 – /extract v2  
![Extract v2 Main](/images/launch-week/lw3-d3-l.webp)

### Overview  
Today we’re launching **/extract v2**, a major upgrade to our extraction system — powered by the FIRE-1 agent.

With full support for **pagination, multi-step flows, and dynamic interactions**, extract v2 goes way beyond what we shipped back in January. It’s also now possible to extract data **without a URL**, using a built-in search layer to find the content you’re after.

We’ve rebuilt the internals from the ground up — improved models, better architecture, and significantly better performance across our internal benchmarks.

### Key Features  
- **FIRE-1 Integration**: Automatically handles page actions, navigation, and interaction.  
- **Multi-Page Extraction**: Extract data across paginated or step-based flows.  
- **No URL Required**: Use built-in search to extract content without a direct link.  
- **Improved Accuracy**: New models and architecture mean better, faster results.  

## Day 2 - FIRE-1 Agent

### Overview
Meet **FIRE-1**, Firecrawl's first AI Agent built to take web scraping to the next level. With intelligent navigation and interaction capabilities, FIRE-1 can go far beyond traditional scraping methods.

From handling pagination to interacting with dynamic site elements like buttons and links, FIRE-1 allows for powerful, context-aware scraping and extraction workflows.

- **Dynamic Interaction**: Click buttons, follow links, and interact with JavaScript-rendered components.


## Day 1 - Change Tracking
![Change Tracking Main](/images/launch-week/lw3d1.webp)


### Overview
Change tracking is a powerful feature that allows you to monitor and detect changes in web content over time. It is available in both the JavaScript and Python SDKs.
![Change Tracking](/images/launch-week/lw3d12.webp)
### Key Features
- **Detect Changes**: Identify if a webpage has changed since the last scrape.
- **View Specific Changes**: Access detailed information about what has changed between scrapes.
- **Structured Data**: Receive structured data about the changes.
- **Visibility Control**: Manage the visibility of changes on your website.

Using the `changeTracking` format, you can effectively monitor changes on a website and receive comprehensive information about the timestamp of the previous scrape, the result of the comparison between the two page versions, and the visibility of the current page/URL.
