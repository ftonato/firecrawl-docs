## Installation

To install the Firecrawl Go SDK, you can use go get:

<InstallGoSDK />

## Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the `API key` as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` struct.
3. Set the `API URL` and/or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` struct. Defaults to `https://api.firecrawl.dev`.
4. Set the `version` and/or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` struct. Defaults to `v1`.


Here's an example of how to use the SDK with error handling:

<ScrapeAndCrawlGoExample />

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL with error handling, use the `ScrapeURL` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

<ScrapeGoShort />

### Crawling a Website

To crawl a website, use the `CrawlUrl` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

### Checking Crawl Status

To check the status of a crawl job, use the `CheckCrawlStatus` method. It takes the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job.

<CheckCrawlStatusGoShort />

### Map a Website

Use `MapUrl` to generate a list of URLs from a website. The `params` argument let you customize the mapping process, including options to exclude subdomains or to utilize the sitemap.

## Error Handling

The SDK handles errors returned by the Firecrawl API and raises appropriate exceptions. If an error occurs during a request, an exception will be raised with a descriptive error message.
