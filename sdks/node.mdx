## Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

<InstallationNode />

## Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.


Here's an example of how to use the SDK with error handling:

<ScrapeAndCrawlExampleNode />

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL with error handling, use the `scrapeUrl` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

<ScrapeNodeShort />

### Crawling a Website

To crawl a website with error handling, use the `crawlUrl` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

### Checking Crawl Status

To check the status of a crawl job with error handling, use the `checkCrawlStatus` method. It takes the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job.

<CheckCrawlStatusNodeShort />

### Mapping a Website

To map a website with error handling, use the `mapUrl` method. It takes the starting URL as a parameter and returns the mapped data as a dictionary.

<MapNodeShort />

## Error Handling

The SDK handles errors returned by the Firecrawl API and raises appropriate exceptions. If an error occurs during a request, an exception will be raised with a descriptive error message. The examples above demonstrate how to handle these errors using `try/catch` blocks.
