title: 'Get Crawl Status'
openapi: 'GET /crawl/status/{jobId}'
---


This endpoint retrieves the status of a crawl job. If the job is not completed, the response includes content within `partial_data`. Once the job is completed, the content is available under `data`.


**We recommend keeping track of the crawl jobs yourself as the crawl status results can expire after 24 hours.**
