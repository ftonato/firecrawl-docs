> Note: this example is using [v0 version of the Firecrawl API](/v0/introduction). You can adapt the sdk call by specifying the version in the `FirecrawlApp(version="v0")` initializer. Current version of Firecrawl API is v1.

> [GitHub repository (https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook) ](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/tree/main/examples/scrape-and-analyze-airbnb-data-with-firecrawl)

This example demonstrates how to scrape Airbnb data and analyze it using [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and the [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter) from E2B.

We won't write any of the analysis code and instead we will have Anthropic's AI write it for us. We will use E2B's Code Interpreter SDK to safely run the code and get the results.
