FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities. It can controls browser actions and navigates complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.




### What FIRE-1 Can Do:
- Plan and take actions to uncover data
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.
- Get mulitple pages of data that require pagination, multiple steps, etc.



## How to Enable FIRE-1

Activating FIRE-1 is straightforward. Simply include an `agent` object in your scrape API request:

```json
"agent": {
  "model": "FIRE-1",
  "prompt": "Your detailed navigation instructions here."
}
```

*Note:* The `prompt` field is required for scrape requests, instructing FIRE-1 precisely how to interact with the webpage. For `/extract` it will use the prompt provided in the `prompt` parameter on the body of the request so you can omit the above `agent.prompt` field.



## Example Usage with Scrape Endpoint

Here's a quick example using FIRE-1 with the scrape endpoint to get the companies on the consumer space from Y Combinator:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://ycombinator.com/companies",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "agent": {
      "model": "FIRE-1",
      "prompt": "Get W22 companies on the consumer space by clicking the respective buttons"
    }
  }'
```
In this scenario, FIRE-1 intelligently clicks the W22 button, the Consumer space button and scrapes the companies.


## Using FIRE-1 with the Extract Endpoint

Similarly, you can leverage the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/extract` endpoint for complex extraction tasks that require navigation across multiple pages or interaction with elements.

**Example (cURL):**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/extract \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "urls": ["https://example-forum.com/topic/123"],
      "prompt": "Extract all user comments from this forum thread.",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "comments": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "author": {"type": "string"},
                "comment_text": {"type": "string"}
              },
              "required": ["author", "comment_text"]
            }
          }
        },
        "required": ["comments"]
      },
      "agent": {
        "model": "FIRE-1"
      }
    }'
```
