Firecrawl converts web pages into markdown, ideal for LLM applications.

- It manages complexities: proxies, caching, rate limits, js-blocked content
- Handles dynamic content: dynamic websites, js-rendered sites, PDFs, images
- Outputs clean markdown, structured data, screenshots or html.

For details, see the [Scrape Endpoint API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).


## Scraping a URL with Firecrawl

### /scrape endpoint

Used to scrape a URL and get its content.

### Installation 

<CodeGroup>

  <InstallationPython />

  <InstallationNode />

  <InstallationGo />
  
  <InstallationRust />

</CodeGroup>

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

  <ScrapePython />

  <ScrapeNode />

  <ScrapeGo />

  <ScrapeRust />

  <ScrapeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

For more details about the parameters, refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.

<ScrapeResponse />

## Extract structured data

### /scrape (with extract) endpoint

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
<ExtractNode />
<ExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractOutput />

### Extracting without schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractNoSchemaCURL />

</CodeGroup>

Output:

<ExtractNoSchemaOutput />

### Extract object

The `extract` object accepts the following parameters:

- `schema`: The schema to use for the extraction.
- `systemPrompt`: The system prompt to use for the extraction.
- `prompt`: The prompt to use for the extraction without a schema.



## Interacting with the page with Actions

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
        "url": "google.com",
        "formats": ["markdown", "screenshot"],
        "actions": [
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "screenshot"}
        ]
    }'
```

For more details about the actions parameters, refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).
