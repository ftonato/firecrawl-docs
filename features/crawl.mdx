Firecrawl thoroughly crawls websites, ensuring comprehensive data extraction while bypassing any web blocker mechanisms. Here's how it works:

1. **URL Analysis:**
   Begins with a specified URL, identifying links by looking at the sitemap and then crawling the website. If no sitemap is found, it will crawl the website following the links.

2. **Recursive Traversal:**
   Recursively follows each link to uncover all subpages.

3. **Content Scraping:**
   Gathers content from every visited page while handling any complexities like JavaScript rendering or rate limits.

4. **Result Compilation:**
   Converts collected data into clean markdown or structured output, perfect for LLM processing or any other task.

This method guarantees an exhaustive crawl and data collection from any starting URL.


## Crawling

### /crawl endpoint

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.


### Installation 

<CodeGroup>

<InstallationPython />
<InstallationNode />
<InstallationGo />
<InstallationRust />

</CodeGroup>

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<CrawlPython />
<CrawlNode />
<CrawlGo />
<CrawlRust />
<CrawlCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Job ID Response

If you're using cURL or `async crawl` functions on SDKs, this will return an `ID` where you can use to check the status of the crawl.

<AsyncCrawlOutput />

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.
<CodeGroup>

<CheckCrawlJobPython />
<CheckCrawlJobNode />
<CheckCrawlJobGo />
<CheckCrawlJobRust />
<CheckCrawlJobCURL />

</CodeGroup>

#### Response

The response will be different depending on the status of the crawl.

## Crawl WebSocket

Firecrawl's WebSocket-based method, `Crawl URL and Watch`, enables real-time data extraction and monitoring. Start a crawl with a URL and customize it with options like page limits, allowed domains, and output formats, ideal for immediate data processing needs.
