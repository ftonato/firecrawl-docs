Change tracking becomes even more powerful when combined with crawling. While change tracking on individual pages shows you content changes, using it with crawl lets you monitor your entire website structure - showing new pages, removed pages, and pages that have become hidden.

## Basic Usage

To enable change tracking during a crawl, include it in the `formats` array of your `scrapeOptions`:

```typescript
// JavaScript/TypeScript
const app = new FirecrawlApp({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
const result = await app.crawl('https://example.com', {
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ['markdown', 'changeTracking']
  }
});

// Each page in the results will include change tracking data
result.pages.forEach(page => {
  console.log(page.url);
  console.log(page.changeTracking.changeStatus); // 'new', 'same', 'changed', or 'removed'
  console.log(page.changeTracking.visibility); // 'visible' or 'hidden'
});
```

```python
# Python
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your-api-key')
result = app.crawl('https://example.com', {
    'scrapeOptions': {
        'formats': ['markdown', 'changeTracking']
    }
})

# Each page in the results will include change tracking data
for page in result['pages']:
    print(page['url'])
    print(page['changeTracking']['changeStatus'])  # 'new', 'same', 'changed', or 'removed'
    print(page['changeTracking']['visibility'])  # 'visible' or 'hidden'
```

## Understanding Change Status

When using change tracking with crawl, the `changeStatus` field becomes especially valuable:

- `new`: A page that didn't exist in your previous crawl
- `same`: A page that exists and hasn't changed since your last crawl
- `changed`: A page that exists but has been modified since your last crawl
- `removed`: A page that existed in your previous crawl but is no longer found

## Page Visibility

The `visibility` field helps you understand how pages are discovered:

- `visible`: The page is discoverable through links or the sitemap
- `hidden`: The page still exists but is no longer linked or in the sitemap

This is particularly useful for:
- Detecting orphaned content
- Finding pages accidentally removed from navigation
- Monitoring site structure changes
- Identifying content that should be re-linked or removed

## Example: Monitoring Site Changes

Here's a practical example that categorizes pages based on their status:

```typescript
const result = await app.crawl('https://example.com', {
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ['markdown', 'changeTracking']
  }
});

const changes = {
  new: [] as string[],
  removed: [] as string[],
  hidden: [] as string[],
  modified: [] as string[]
};

result.pages.forEach(page => {
  if (page.changeTracking.changeStatus === 'new') {
    changes.new.push(page.url);
  } else if (page.changeTracking.changeStatus === 'removed') {
    changes.removed.push(page.url);
  } else if (page.changeTracking.visibility === 'hidden') {
    changes.hidden.push(page.url);
  } else if (page.changeTracking.changeStatus === 'changed') {
    changes.modified.push(page.url);
  }
});

console.log('Site Changes:', changes);
```
