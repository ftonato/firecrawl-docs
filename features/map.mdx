## Introducing /map (Beta)

The easiest way to go from a single url to a map of the entire website. This is extremely useful for:
- Need user feedback on links to [/features/scrape](/features/scrape)
- Need to scrape pages of a website that are related to a specific topic
- Only need to scrape specific pages of a website

## Beta Considerations

This endpoint prioritizes speed, so it may not capture all website links. We are working on improvements. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome.


## Mapping

### /map endpoint

Used to map a URL and get urls of the website. This returns most links present on the website.
