Firecrawl's search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation.

- Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
- Search the web with customizable parameters (language, country, etc.)
- Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats
- Control the number of results and set timeouts

For details, see the [Search Endpoint API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/search).

### Custom Timeout

Set a custom timeout for search operations:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

# Initialize the client with your API key
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Set a 30-second timeout
search_result = app.search(
    "complex search query",
    limit=10,
    timeout=30000  # 30 seconds in milliseconds
)
```

```js JavaScript
import FirecrawlApp from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

// Initialize the client with your API key
const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

// Set a 30-second timeout
app.search("complex search query", {
  limit: 10,
  timeout: 30000  // 30 seconds in milliseconds
})
.then(searchResult => {
  // Process results
  console.log(searchResult.data);
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "complex search query",
    "limit": 10,
    "timeout": 30000
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Scraping Options

When scraping search results, you can specify multiple output formats:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

# Initialize the client with your API key
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get search results with multiple formats
search_result = app.search(
    "firecrawl features",
    limit=3,
    scrape_options={
        "formats": ["markdown", "html", "links", "screenshot"]
    }
)
```

```js JavaScript
import FirecrawlApp from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

// Initialize the client with your API key
const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

// Get search results with multiple formats
app.search("firecrawl features", {
  limit: 3,
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ["markdown", "html", "links", "screenshot"]
  }
})
.then(searchResult => {
  // Process results with various formats
  console.log(searchResult.data);
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
