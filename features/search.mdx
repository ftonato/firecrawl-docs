## Searching the web and scraping the results with Firecrawl

Firecrawl integrates its SERP (Search Engine Results Page) API with its robust scraping infrastructure to provide a seamless search and scrape functionality through a single endpoint. Here's why:

1. **Unified Search Query:**
   Users submit a search query via the SERP endpoint.

2. **Automated Result Scraping:**
   Firecrawl automatically processes the search results and utilizes its scraping capabilities to extract data from each result page.

3. **Data Delivery:**
   The scraped data from all result pages is compiled and delivered in a clean markdown - ready to use.

This integration allows users to efficiently perform web searches and obtain comprehensive, scraped data from multiple sources with minimal effort.

For more details, refer to the [Search Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/search).

## Search any query

### /search endpoint

Used to search the web, get the most relevant results, scrape each page and return the markdown.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/search \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "query": "firecrawl",
      "pageOptions": {
        "fetchPageContent": true // false for a fast serp api
      }
    }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://mendable.ai",
      "markdown": "# Markdown Content",
      "provider": "web-scraper",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable | AI for CX and Sales",
        "description": "AI for CX and Sales",
        "language": null,
        "sourceURL": "https://www.mendable.ai/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### With Python SDK

#### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

#### Search a query

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

result = app.search(query="What is firecrawl?")
```


The response will be similar to the one shown in the curl command above.

### With JavaScript SDK

#### Installing JavaScript SDK

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

#### Search a query

```javascript
import FirecrawlApp from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

// Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key
const app = new FirecrawlApp({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Perform a search
const result = await app.search('What is firecrawl?');
```

The response will be similar to the one shown in the curl command above.

### With Go SDK

#### Installing Go SDK

```bash
go get github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-go
```

#### Search a query

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "log"

  "github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-go"
)

func main() {
  app, err := firecrawl.NewFirecrawlApp("YOUR_API_KEY")
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize FirecrawlApp: %v", err)
  }

  query := "What is firecrawl?"
  searchResult, err := app.Search(query)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to search: %v", err)
  }
  fmt.Println(searchResult)
}
```

### With Rust SDK

#### Installing Rust SDK

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
firecrawl = "^0.1"
tokio = { version = "^1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "^1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "^1.0"
uuid = { version = "^1.10", features = ["v4"] }

[build-dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

#### Search a query

```rust
async fn main() {
  let api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  let api_url = "https://api.firecrawl.dev";
  let app = FirecrawlApp::new(api_key, api_url).expect("Failed to initialize FirecrawlApp");

  let query = "What is firecrawl?";
  let search_result = app.search(query).await;

  match search_result {
    Ok(data) => println!("Search Result: {}", data),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to search: {}", e),
  }
}
```
