## Introducing Deep Research (Alpha)

The `/deep-research` endpoint enables AI-powered deep research and analysis on any topic. Simply provide a research query, and Firecrawl will autonomously explore the web, gather relevant information, and synthesize findings into comprehensive insights.

## Using `/deep-research`

Deep Research works by:
1. Analyzing your query to identify key research areas
2. Iteratively searching and exploring relevant web content
3. Synthesizing information from multiple sources
4. Providing structured findings with source attribution

### Example Usage

<CodeGroup>

<DeepResearchPython />
<DeepResearchNode />
<DeepResearchCURL />

</CodeGroup>

**Key Parameters:**

- **query**: The research topic or question you want to investigate
- **maxDepth** (Optional): Maximum number of research iterations (1-10, default: 7)
- **timeLimit** (Optional): Time limit in seconds (30-300, default: 270)
- **maxUrls** (Optional): Maximum number of URLs to analyze (1-1000, default: 20)

See [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/deep-research) for more details.

### Response

<DeepResearchOutput />

## Monitoring Research Progress

Deep Research jobs run asynchronously. You can monitor progress and receive real-time updates:

<CodeGroup>

<CheckStatusPython />
<CheckStatusNode />
<CheckStatusCURL />

</CodeGroup>


### Research Activities

The data response includes:

- **activities**: List of research activities with the following properties:
  - `type`: Type of activity ('search', 'extract', 'analyze', 'reasoning', 'synthesis', 'thought')
  - `status`: Activity status ('processing', 'complete', 'error')
  - `message`: Description of the activity or finding
  - `timestamp`: ISO timestamp of when the activity occurred
  - `depth`: Current research depth level
- **sources**: Referenced URLs with titles and descriptions
  - `title`: Title of the source
  - `description`: Description of the source
  - `url`: URL of the source
  - `icon`: Icon of the source
- **finalAnalysis**: Comprehensive analysis (when completed)

### Status Examples


#### In Progress

<StatusPending />

#### Completed

<StatusCompleted />



## Known Limitations (Alpha)

1. **Research Scope**  
   Best suited for topics with publicly available information. May not access paywalled or private content.

2. **Time Constraints**  
   Research jobs are limited to 10 minutes maximum to ensure reasonable response times.

3. **Source Verification**  
   While sources are provided, manual verification of critical information is recommended.

4. **Alpha State**  
   As an Alpha feature, the research methodology and output format may evolve based on feedback.

## Billing and Usage

Billing is done based on the number of `urls` analyzed. Each `url` is 1 credit. You can specify the max number of urls to analyze with the `maxUrls` parameter.
